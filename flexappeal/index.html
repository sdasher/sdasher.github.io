                <p>Trista is a native Texan, retired radio DJ, wife, mother, and avid mountain biker. She is also a certified personal trainer and nutrition coach.</P>
                <P> Trista started Flex Appeal in 2015 as a fitness studio where women could push their limits, outside the competitive, body-negative atmosphere of traditional gyms. </P>
                <p> Since that time, Flex Appeal has grown into a full-service gym, online community, and safe space, where women of all backgrounds and all fitness levels come together to be empowered through movement.</p>

                <p> <i>I have always needed a friend to go to a gym with me--but friends always have an excuse, so I would, too. After meeting with Trista the second time, I felt a calmness come over me, and a belief that I could do this on my own.

                <p data-scroll>
                  <p>Many of us have spent a lifetime learning that exercise is a punishment--for laziness, for unhealthy eating, for not being strong enough or attractive enough. Or maybe we feel that exercise is something virtuous that we "should
                    do", so when we skip it, we feel guilt and shame. At Flex Appeal, we believe that the mind and body grow stronger together, and we strive above all to change our members' attitudes toward exercise. By providing the encouragement
                    and the listening ear they need, our members leave the gym feeling proud, hopeful and energized to follow a healthier lifestyle.</p>
                  <br>

                  <p> Here's what our members have to say:</P>
                  <br>

                  <p>Flex Appeal has been a game changer for me. This is my safe place that I actually enjoy going to. I'm someone who really hates working out, but after having baby number two and turning 30, it's a necessary evil. The staff is so
                    much more than employees of the gym. They are friends that care and support us, whether it's fitness-related or not. Weight loss and diet are not forced down my throat. It's simply wonderful. - Taylor H.
                  </p>

                  <p>I've only got one shot at this life thing and I've spent the last ten ears of it unfit mentally and physically. Tomorrow is never guaranteed, but if I can spend this moment healthier than the last, then I am winning. - Elia M.
                  </p>


                  <p> My 'why' has changed since attending Flex Appeal. In the beginning, I thought is was for my grandkids or my golf game. No! It's for me! - Doris S.</P>
