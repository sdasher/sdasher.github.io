        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>A drilling rig is no place to rely on rookies. Our people average nearly 20 years of experience, specializing in the most challenging downhole projects.</p>
        <p>Our formula for success is simple: hire experienced people, then give them the newest and safest equipment to do their jobs. This formula has helped us become, over the past 30 years, the most respected and successful logging company in the Anadarko Basin.</p>
        <p>Our experience allows us to take on jobs that other companies deem too risky to attempt. We are pioneers in high-pressure, high-temperature, and ultra-deep horizontal wells that defy normal drilling parameters. Most importantly, we boast a near-flawless safety record in spite of our challenging portfolio.</p>
      </adrticle>

      <adrticle class="index-box"  id="reliability">
        <h1>Reliability</h1>

        <p>Drilling decisions need to be made fast. Delays can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a day.  With over 1000 horizontal wells successfully landed since 2003, we are proud that 98% of projects are for repeat customers.<br></P>
                <p>We provide real-time data, 24-hour accessibility, and cutting-edge instrumentation to drive your critical production decisions. </p>
<p>A two-geologist team will stay with your well from surface to Total Depth, providing 24/7 monitoring, troubleshooting, and communication for the duration of your drill. An engineer is always on-site to maintain logging equipment and sensors.</p>
        <p>We know that communication is key to a successful well. Our web portal provides fast and secure web access to a variety of wellsite data sources, including real-time drilling parameters, daily drilling reports, mud logs, and wireline. We employ only certified expert installers to maintain cellular and satellite data uplinks at all of our wellsites. Our unmatched well monitoring infrastructure ensures that our team, and our team, will never be out of touch.</P>
