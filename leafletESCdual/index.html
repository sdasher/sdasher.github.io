		<p>In 2004, Texas set out to reduce special education enrollment by setting a "target" for school districts that reduced enrollment by nearly a third. Before the cap, special education share in Texas was 11.8 percent of all students, close to the national average. Between 2004 and 2014, the Texas figure fell to 8.6 percent, while nationwide enrollment nationwide remained largely unchanged. When the cap was finally lifted by court order in 2017, enrollment surged once again.
